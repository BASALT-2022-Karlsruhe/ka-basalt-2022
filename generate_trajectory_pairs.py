# TODO
# - run rollouts for each task and record video and input data
# - preprocess video and input stream into observation and action data
# - select trajectory pairs among the produced rollouts based on some criterion (e.g. random choice, differences in trajectories, variance in an ensemble of reward models)
# - safe the preprocessed trajectory pairs
